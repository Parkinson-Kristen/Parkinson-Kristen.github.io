	  it sits on a small hill perfectly situated to be seen from miles around.</h2>

	  <h2>Tucson Arizona</h2>
	  <h2>The Tucson Arizona temple was one of the most contested temples in Arizona.  Residents of the area fought the temple placement
	  for years, but today, with home prices around the temple grounds and the beauty of the surrounding, hopefully residents are a little
	  more accepting.</h2>
